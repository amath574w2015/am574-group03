Title: Adaptive Mesh Refinement for 1D Hyperbolic PDEs

Abstract: We describe an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm that extends high resolution wave-progpagation techniques to hyperbolic systems in non-conservative form. The algorithm was implemented and tested for simple 1D problems. Results are compared to static mesh solutions for the same problems.
