\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Essential figure for flux adapting Cartesian grids. The top grid is the normal coarse grid we are used to using with fluxes indicated. The middle diagram shows the case where a fine grid overlays a coarse grid and the interface region of fine and coarse grids. Recall that $2\mathaccentV {hat}05E{h}=h$ and $2\mathaccentV {hat}05E{k}=k$. The bottom diagram depicts the ghost cell region imposed on the coarse cell interface as well as the fine grid fluxes needed to bridge the interface.}}{9}
